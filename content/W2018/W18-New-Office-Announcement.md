Summary: Announcing our new office location

Hi Everyone, 

We have moved to **MC 1011** due to the fact that the west side of MC
will be torn down for PAC expansion soon. Our office hours will
resume as usual in the new location. The schedule for this term's 
office hours is [here]({filename}/W2018/W18-Office-Hours.md).

We also got some new office supplies:

- Candies, chocolate, chips and pops
- New books: Algorithms, Design Patterns
- Microwave 
- Mini-Fridge
- Scanner
- Phone / Laptop chargers

Welcome to drop by our office when you have time and feel free to use
anything in the office during your visit!
